# JWPlayerFeasibilityTest
JWPlayer integration and testing various features that are available with it.

This is a working example with use of all the configurations available for the player.

All you need to do is put your key (The key that you get on signup/purchase of JWPlayer) in the Info.plist. You will find an entry there with text "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
replace that and run the project.
